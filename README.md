# labyrinth

A program for finding a path to exit a labyrinth. The program will receive as input a file with a specification of the labyrinth, and it will produce as output a path from the entrance to the exit, if any exists. Think of the labyrinth as a set of rooms connected by corridors, some of which could be closed by walls. There are 3 types of walls: brick walls (displayed by the program in red), rock walls (displayed by the program in blue), and metal walls. The labyrinth might not have a path to the exit; in that case your program is allowed to break some of the walls to try to reach the exit. The program is given two types of bombs to break walls: blast bombs and melt bombs. A blast bomb can break a brick wall, but not a metal wall; a rock wall needs 2 blast bombs to be broken. A melt bomb can break a metal wall, but not a brick or a rock wall. The program will be given k1 blast bombs and k2 melt bombs, where k1 and k1 are specified in the input file. The program will represent the labyrinth as an undirected graph. Every node of the graph corresponds to a room, and every edge corresponds to either a corridor that can be used to go from one room to the other or to a wall that the program might decide to break. There are two special nodes in this graph corresponding to the entrance and the exit. A modified depth first search traversal, for example, can be used to find a solution for the labyrinth.
